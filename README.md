### Virtual Environment Setup

Create a virtual environment to install project-level dependencies with the following command:

Windows:
```
py -m venv env_name
```

Linux/macOS:
```
python3 -m venv env_name
```

After executing these commands, a folder with the name of the virtual environment will be created in the current directory. To activate the virtual environment, follow these additional steps:

Windows (PowerShell):
```
.\env_name\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Windows (Command Prompt):
```
env_name\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Linux/macOS:
```
source env_name/bin/activate
```

Once your virtual environment is initialized, you can install the dependencies with the following command:


Windows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Linux y macOS:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
